# site
Dependencies
-------------
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)
- [Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/)
- [Python2.x](https://www.python.org/)

Running
-------------
- make sure you are in the top level directory of the project
- installing dependencies:
  - python generate_static.py
  - bower install
  - compass watch (Ctrl C after it writes main.css)
- running the site:
  - python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
  - navigate to localhost:3000

How Does It Work?
--------------
File structure:

    index.html          --> main point of entry
    generate_static.py  --> generates static pages for each route
    config.rb           --> when using "compass watch" creates css/main.css if it does not exist, updates it based on css/main.scss otherwise
    bower.json          --> dependencies
    base_file.html      --> file that is used by generate_static.py to generate static pages
    views/              --> partials that are loaded in for each route
    static/             --> folder generated by generate_static.py, every file in it is identical with the difference of what partial view gets loaded
    js/                 --> contains the javascript controllers for each route
      loadRoute.js      --> registers each route with its partial view and a controller
    img/                --> image assets
    data/               --> data assets for the site in json form
    css/                --> css and sass files
    bower_components    --> created by "bower install" external dependencies
    .sass-cache         --> meta data for sass created after using "compass watch"
