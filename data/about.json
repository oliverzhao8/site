aboutData = `I was born and raised in New York City by a family that 
fostered my love for design. Currently, I am a sophomore at 
The Rhode Island School of Design studying industrial design. 
Throughout my fall semester, I have learned about developing 
shapes for products, researching a specific market, conveying 
information in unique ways, branding, and designing for 
clients. Through learning these skills, I have also sharpened 
my skills in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. My other classes 
have also taught me about the capabilities and limitations of 
two of the most commonly used materials: wood and metal. 
Aside from my already busy school life, I have been tampering 
with standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and 
Javascript and would like to further experiment with 
technologies that enhance user experience. My goal as a 
designer is to compound on the things people take for 
granted and bring out the best of whatever I am designing.`
