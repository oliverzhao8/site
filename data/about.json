aboutData = `I was born and raised in New York City by a family that fostered my love for art and technology.
 Currently, I am a freshman at The Rhode Island School of Design studying industrial design.
 This past semester, as a freshman, I primarily took foundational classes in art and design.
 Some classes I took include drawing, design, and spatial dynamics.
 I am currently taking an introductory class in computer animation.
 Recently, I have been developing websites using standard web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
 I mostly deal with creating content using Adobe software.
 My goal is to create better interfaces that bridge the digital and physical worlds.`
