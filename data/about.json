aboutData = `I was born and raised in New York City by a family that 
fostered my love for design. Currently, I am a junior at 
The Rhode Island School of Design studying industrial design. 
My goal is to explore as many 'materials,' both digital and physical,
to hopefully one day create a product that can help change the world.`
