I created a sentient piece of buttered toast with a face, various replacement parts (different forms for the eyes and mouth), arms, and legs using Adobe Illustrator. Then I used After Effects to connect all the parts of character and allowed it to have smooth animation in 24 fps. I made a short gif  that shows the toast dancing by importing an image sequence in Photoshop. Below is the original rig layout in Illustrator. The red points represent pivot points.",

Because some people, including myself, have the habit to rock on uneven stools, I made a chair that emphasizes that habit. Hence, I made a chair that rocks on two axes. Throughout the process, I learned a lot about woodworking such as making complex joints and creating robust structures.",
