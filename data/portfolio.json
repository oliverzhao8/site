  "name": "A Toasty Character",
  "description": "RISD Winter 2015\nIllustator, Photoshop, After Effects\n\nOne project of my intro to computer animation class was to create a character rig and animate it. I created a sentient piece of buttered toast with a face, various replacement parts (different forms for the eyes and mouth), arms, and legs using Adobe Illustrator. Then I used After Effects to connect all the parts of character and allowed it to have smooth animation in 24 fps. I made a short gif  that shows the toast dancing by importing an image sequence in Photoshop. Below is the original rig layout in Illustrator. The red points represent pivot points.",

  "description": "RISD Fall 2015\n24'' x 24'' x 18''\n2 x 1 pine select\nFor my spacial dynamics’ final, my class was assigned to build a chair mainly constructed by 1 by 2 pine selects. Because some people, including myself, have the habit to rock on uneven stools, I made a chair that emphasizes that habit. Hence, I made a chair that rocks on two axes. Throughout the process, I learned a lot about woodworking such as making complex joints and creating robust structures.",

I chose to draw the philtrum (the obscure indent between the nose and lip) in a manner that makes it appear as an important symbol, although the reference to the philtrum is actually quite silly.",
